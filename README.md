# About this branch
This is a branch of the [**pokeemerald**](https://travis-ci.org/pret/pokeemerald) dissasembly that is meant to act as somewhat of a demake of ORAS with as many of their mechanics as possible, but with Emerald's story.
It uses the [**feature_update**](https://github.com/Artrios/pokeemerald/tree/feature_update) branch as a base.

This is a decompilation of Pokémon Emerald.

It builds the following ROM:
